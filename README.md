## Navigating This Repo

Each feature I intend to work on has it's own dedicated branch where I've outlined specific areas of growth I will work on for that feature.

I'll also document any resources I found helpful for studying each feature and a summary of the practice scenario, in case others visiting this repo find them useful.

Please visit the [branch overview page]() to see an overview of all practice concepts and features in this repo. To keep things organized, a breakdown of each practice scenario for each feature branch will be maintained in individual pull requests for review.

Thanks for visiting <span>&#128075;&#127998;</span>
