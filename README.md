## Navigating This Repo

Each feature I'm practicing will have a dedicated branch where I've outlined specific areas of growth I will work on for that feature.

I'll also document any resources I found helpful for studying each feature and a summary of the practice scenario, in case others visiting this repo find them useful.

Please visit the [branch overview page](https://github.com/tammytee/vue-practice/branches) to get an overview of all practice concepts and features in this repo. To keep things organized, a breakdown of each practice scenario for each feature branch will be maintained in individual [pull requests](https://github.com/tammytee/vue-practice/pulls) for review.
